## Components/Wiring/Requirements
* Raspberry Pi Zero WF (RPi0)- for wifi and headless install/no miniHDMI converter needed (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3708) 
* Micro SD Card
* TM 1637 Display (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DKISMXK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* Pushbutton (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C8CS7EI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* Contour Next Link 2.4 (CNL) and Medtronic 600 Series Pump
* OTG cable - to connect CNL to RPi0
* Wires to solder PB and Display to RPi0

## Configure RPi0
1. Install Raspbian Lite onto your SD Card (you don't need to format or partition it prior/the install will do it):
  * Download Raspian Lite: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
    - Note: I used 2018-10-09-raspbian-stretch (I could not headlessly configure the wireless with the later version/ not sure why - 2018-11-13-raspbian-stretch-lite)
  * Get/install Etcher (to use to move/install Raspian onto the SD card): https://www.balena.io/etcher/
  * Open etcher and flash Raspian Lite onto your SD card (Note: this creates a small 'boot' drive and another drive - On windows i was required to format it so I created it only the default size (1.69GB/FAT)
2. On your SD card - Edit the files below (refer to: https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-zero-creation/text-file-editing)
  * Open file: config.txt (DONT USE NOTEPAD, Use Notepad++ or an app that won't mess up formatting):
    - At bottom add:     
    > # Enable UART
    > enable_uart=1
  * Create new file called: wpa_supplicant.conf
    - Open/edit it with your info/example below (left alligned):
    > ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    > update_config=1
    > country=US
    >  
    > network={
    >     ssid="YOURSSID"
    >     psk="YOURPASSWORD"
    >     scan_ssid=1
    > } 
  * Create a new file called ssh (no .txt extention or any extension), and don't edit it/keep it as an empty file.
3. Move the SD to the RPi0, and confirm it connects to your wireless network:
  * Eject your SD card and put it into your RPi0.  Use the 1st/TOPMOST USB PORT (if using a RPi0) and plug it into your computer - wait until green light stops blinking.
  * If you are using Windows, install Bonjour Print Services for Windows v2.0.2 - https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999?locale=en_US (I'm not sure if this is actually required but I did it)
  * Open a command prompt and try to ping the RPi0 by hostname - With windows prompt: ping raspberrypi.local
  * If you can't ping it, then you'll need to ping it by IP instead.  To figure out the RPi0's IP - I used: https://papertrailapp.com/ (IDed it's IP: saw 'raspberry' in a recent log with its IP)
4. SSH to the RPi0 (use PuTTY/install if you don't have):
  * Open Putty, and Enter hostname: pi@hostname(or IP) (all others default/SSH)
  * Enter default RPi0 password: raspberry
5. RPi0 Initial Setup (refer to: https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-zero-creation/first-login)
  * Run system update:
    > sudo apt-get update
    > sudo apt-get upgrade
  * Run:
    > sudo raspi-config
       - Select: Change user password and change from default (remember it/don't loose it!)
       - Select: 'Interfacing Options' and choose options to turn on SSH (although maybe not really needed being a boot file was made to set this on already)
       - Select: 'Advanced Options' - Choose A1-Expand Filesystem (so that all of you SD card is available)
       - Select: 'Update this Tool to the latest Version'
6. Install additional required Rpi0 software:
  * Confirm that you have Python 2.7 and PIP installed (Raspbian Stretch Lite comes w Python 2 and PIP for python2):  
    > python --version
    > pip --version
  * Install needed libraries:
    > sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
    > sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
    > sudo apt-get install python-lzo
    > sudo sudo apt-get install git-core
  * Install needed python packages:
    > sudo -H pip2 install cython
    > sudo -H pip2 install hidapi
    > sudo -H pip2 install requests astm PyCrypto crc16 python-dateutil
    > sudo -H pip2 install RPi.GPIO (was actually already installed)
    - Note: If you get an error when trying any of the above installs, then read the error you get, to see which .h file or director was missing and search for a package which may include it with: apt-cache search FILENAME.  Then install it with: sudo apt-get install PACKAGENAME  
7. Git - Clone and switch to branch:
  * Clone git project:
    > git clone https://github.com/shelsgit/decoding-contour-next-link.git
  * Switch to Alarm Clock Branch:
    > git checkout CNL-RPi0-AlarmClock
8. Run the program (Make sure you did the git step above to make sure you're in the right branch!):
> cd /home/pi/
> sudo python2.7 -m decoding-contour-next-link.read_minimed_next24
(TO CHANGE THIS SO IT RUNs on startup)
